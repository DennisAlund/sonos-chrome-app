# sonos-chrome-app
A SONOS controller app implemented in Angular for Chrome using SonosJS that enables you to controll your SONOS speakers from
a web browser.

N.B.
This is an incomplete implementation that is no longer maintained. It was developed as a proof of concept back when 
[SonosJS](https://github.com/oddbit/sonosjs) was still being maintained.
